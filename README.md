# MonteCarloTutorial

# the first file(assignment_1) is the code for the first assignment 
## we are excepeting to get a sample that is uniformally distributed and a histogram to demonstrate that. 
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# the second file(assignment_2) is the code for second assignment
## we simply want to generate angles that are normally distributed using the method accept and reject.
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# In the third (Calculation of pi) we used the method accept and reject again to calculate the value of "pi".
## to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"
### Here we also there is a part in which we try to see the uncertainity in our calculation which comes with a histogram thats comes after the first one from the pi calculation this histogram is showing the uncertainty of the calculation when try different ways of sampling.
# The file (2D_graphic.py) contains a 2D simulation of the parton shower.
## We are excepecting to see a 2d graph of a parton shower.
### Here also in the file we have the (1/x) distribution of theta and z. 
#### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".
# The file "partonshower3d.py" has a code for simulating a 3D parton shower
## We excepecting to see a 3D plot of a parton shower and a csv file contains the data with the name "parton.csv"
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".

# The three files, anti-kT_algorithm.py, anti-kT_algorithm1.py and anti-kT_algorithm.pdf are related to anti kT algorithm, where the first and the second contains a code for the algorithm and the last one explains the algorithm in details. The second file runs the algorithm for different values of "R" and make a histogram to compare the number of Jets for each r and often the number appears.
