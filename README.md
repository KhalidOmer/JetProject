# MonteCarloTutorial

# the first file(first_assignment.py) is the code for the first assignment 
	* we are excepecting to get a sample that is uniformally distributed and a histogram to demonstrate that. 
	* to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# the second file(second_assignment) is the code for second assignment
	* we simply want to generate angles that are normally distributed using the method accept and reject.
	* to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# In the third (Calculation_of_pi) we used the method accept and reject again to calculate the value of "pi".
	* to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"
	* Here we also there is a part in which we try to see the uncertainity in our calculation which comes with a histogram thats comes after the first one from the pi calculation this histogram is showing the uncertainty of the calculation when try different ways of sampling.

# The file (two_d_partonshower.py) contains a 2D simulation of the parton shower.

 	* We are excepecting to see a 2d graph of a parton shower.
 	* Here also in the file we have the (1/x) distribution of theta and z. 
 	* to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".
 	* The file Distirbutions.py has all the distributions that are used in this excercise.

# The file "partonshower3d.py" has a code for simulating a 3D parton shower

	* We excepecting to see a 3D plot of a parton shower and a csv file contains the data with the name "parton.csv"
	* to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".

# The file  antikT_algorithm.py  
	* contains the implementaion of  anti kT algorithm.  

# The files number_of_jets_observables.py  and file hist_n_of_Jets.py
	* the first file runs the algorithm over a sample of 1000 events. 
	* the second provides a histogram that reflects the relation between the parameter R and the number of Jets.
# The files Pseudomass_observable.py  and  hist_pseudomass.py
	* the first file runs the algorithm of over a sample of 1000 events. 
	* the second produces a histogram of the pseudomass observable considering different values of R.
# The files number_of_constituents_observable.py and hist_of_n_of_constituents.py
	* the first file runs the algorithm over a sample of 1000 events.
	* the second file produces a histogram of the number of constituents of the jet with highest energy considering different values of R.
# The folder Gallery contains examples of running these codes.

# The folder  	PythiaSimulatorAnalysis contains codes that we used in chapter six.
