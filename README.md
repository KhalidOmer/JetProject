# MonteCarloTutorial

# the first file(first_assignment.py) is the code for the first assignment 
## we are excepeting to get a sample that is uniformally distributed and a histogram to demonstrate that. 
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# the second file(second_assignment) is the code for second assignment
## we simply want to generate angles that are normally distributed using the method accept and reject.
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# In the third (Calculation_of_pi) we used the method accept and reject again to calculate the value of "pi".
## to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"
### Here we also there is a part in which we try to see the uncertainity in our calculation which comes with a histogram thats comes after the first one from the pi calculation this histogram is showing the uncertainty of the calculation when try different ways of sampling.
# The file (two_d_partonshower.py) contains a 2D simulation of the parton shower.
## We are excepecting to see a 2d graph of a parton shower.
### Here also in the file we have the (1/x) distribution of theta and z. 
#### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".
# The file Distirbutions.py has all the distributions that are used in this excercise.

# The file "partonshower3d.py" has a code for simulating a 3D parton shower
## We excepecting to see a 3D plot of a parton shower and a csv file contains the data with the name "parton.csv"
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks".

# The two files, antikT_algorithm.py and antikT_algorithm.pdf are related to anti kT algorithm, where the first contains a code for the algorithm and the last one explains the algorithm in details. 

# The file number_of_jets_observables.py runs the algorithm over a sample and also provides a histogram that reflects the relation between the parameter R and the number of Jets.
# The file Pseudomass_observable.py runs the algorithm of over a sample of 100 parton showers and returns a histogram of the pseudomass observable.
