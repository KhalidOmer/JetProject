# Introduction 
At the ** Large Hadron Collider **, highly energetic protons are being collided in order to study physical
phenomena. As a result of these collisions the proton constituents (quarks and gluons) are being
produced. However, in practice, we can not detect them. The quarks and gluons undergo a
showering process and then hadronize. In order to understand them, Monte Carlo simulations
were used, including a simple toy simulation as well as Pythia simulation. In both cases we studied
these simulations using jet algorithms.
