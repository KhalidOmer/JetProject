# Who am I? 
	I am a set of excersices that are based on MonteCarlo tutorial method that is
	 written by Samuel Meehan and Fiona Pons from CERN and implementations of the anti-kT jet algorithms as well as thier observables.
# Who worked on me?
	This is the work of Khalid (student), Dr. Jan Hazla (tutor at AIMS Rwanda) and Dr. Samuel (supervisor). 
# General Notes
	This is a simple model of a very complicated phenomenon and its main purpose is educationl as it does not consider the full discription of the concept. 
# How to run me
	* If you are on LINUX or Unix just open the Terminal and write 'python3 <the name of the file>'.
	* If you are on Windows you would have to install and IDE and then run it from there. 
# Contribute to Us
