# Who I am? 
	I am a set of excersices that are based on MonteCarlo tutorial method that is
	written by Samuel Meehan and Fiona Pons from CERN and implementations of 
	the anti-kT jet algorithms as well as thier observables.
# Who worked on me?
	This is the work of Khalid (student), Dr. Jan Hazla (tutor at AIMS Rwanda) 
	and Dr. Samuel (supervisor). 
# General Notes:
	This is a simple model of a very complicated phenomenon and its main purpose
	is educationl as it does not consider the full discription of the concept. 
# How to run me
* If you are on LINUX or Unix just open the Terminal and write 'python3 <the name of the file>'.
* If you are on Windows you would have to install and IDE and then run it from there. 
# Contribute to Us
* As it's meant for educational purposes so feel free to suggest any improvments and we are welcoming any help.
